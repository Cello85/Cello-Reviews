King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard | Gizzard Teenage (7/10)
Favorite Tracks: Ants And Bats, Summer!, Eddie Cousin, Tomb/Beach, Life Is Cool

This is not *technically* the first actual release by the band (that goes to Anglesea EP) and it's actually one of the most recent releases by KGATLW as part of their "Bootlegger" system, but since the material featured is actually from 2010-11, I've decided to put it where it chronologically belongs: the very start.

As someone who has long loved this band and heared their more moodern output, I find hearing them as this very rough and, to be honest, not that interesting surf garage rock compared to what they would do later on pretty interesting, if just for seeing their evolution and the occasional highlights: as an example, *Summer!* features lyrics that would reappear in *Muddy Water* in Gumboot Soup, the suprise appearance of a female singer on *Good To Me*, the slower *Tomb/Beach* being a nice break from the constant noise-riddled rock of the rest of the songs, and Stu definitely having its hand on those weird guitar noises shit, loud "WOO"s and other weird mouth noises that are basically standard for Gizzard. Oh, and a completely new unreleased track, *Life Is Cool*, so, there's that as well.
