Released in 1989 as one of three demo cassettes, Porcupine Tree at this point was nothing else but Steven Wilson alone doing the majority of the music while his friend Malcolm Stocks provided ideas, extra vocals and guitar sounds, and it all originated as nothing more than a joke band pastiching 60's psych rock in its own, curious way. It's not completely making fun of it, but instead using its tropes and ideas and working them in a new way, which includes Steven's own interest in experimenting with the sounds he could create with guitars and other instruments, and even including a cover of Prince's The Cross. As a simple joke, this is quite a well-made one and somewhat representative of what Porcupine Tree would end up becoming, although it should probably be said that tracks 1-7 would reappear *On The Sunday Of Life...*, while the remaining material would resurface in a compilation of left-over material from the cassettes, *Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape*.
