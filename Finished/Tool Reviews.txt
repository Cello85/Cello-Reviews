Tool is an American prog metal born in 1990, and they are known for complex music writing, strange and often allegoric lyrics, the amazing artwork for their albums, and that it takes a shit load of time for them to release albums - to count, the release between 10,000 Days, which at the time was their latest album, and Fear Inoculum, is 13 years. Now, while I could go over the band's story and such, I'll much rather stick with what's my actual opinion on the albums.

Opiate, Undertow and Fear Inoculum: For me, these are the weakest release by Tool in their catalogue by far, as each album has very heavy cons: Opiate feels a bit too "poppy" and it's also mixed like shit, Undertow is a bit too long and stuffed with songs to the point that it feels bloated, and Fear Inoculum sounds the same a lot of the time in most of the songs, which is really not good.
Aenima and 10,000 Days: Now this is what I'm talking about - especially with Aenima, since it's probably one of the first albums that you will hear talked about in reference to Tool, and with great reasons too - it features some of the band's most exemplar songs, like Stinkfist, Aenema and Forty Six & 2. 10,000 Days, I would say, is much of the same which, which while generally not a bad thing, does make for a somewhat "normal" listen - while still having some bangers, like Wings for Marie/10,000 Days, Rosetta Stoned and Right In Two.

Lateralus: Now, I've got something to say about Lateralus - beyond it being the best release by Tool by far, and that is the thing that you've probably heard about it that isn't about the music, which is the Fibonacci sequence found in the title track. Now, while yes, at face value can be taken as a very pretentious concept (this is prog metal after all), I find that people who talk about it seem to be a bit too focused on it, whether they be people criticizing or praising Tool and this album in specific. Beyond that, however, the album is absolutely chocked on bangers (Lateralus, The Grudge, Ticks & Leeches and the trio Disposition/Reflection/Triad), and probably the Tool album that I'll go back the most.
