So, new chart, new artist. This time, it's 65daysofstatic, an "experimental band" according to Wikipedia, although most associate them with Math Rock and Glitch Music. For some reason they're associated with Post-Rock which I'll content, since they're not really that Post-Rock (none of their songs beyond one or two exceptions from before the Music For An Infinite Universe era are longer than 10 minutes and there's not really that much use of dynamics and blah blah blah). Anyways, minutia for later, and onto the chart:

65daysofstatic | The Fall of Math (8/10)
Favorite Tracks: Retreat! Retreat!, I Swallowed Hard Like I Understood, Aren't We All Running?, The Fall Of Math

As a debut album, it goes quite to show that even earlier on, they had quite a umph to their music with the combination of kinda Post-Hardcore, some elements of Glitch Music and DnB through its 11 tracks and 43 minute of runtime, including their most famous song, Retreat! Retreat!. Also if the names of tracks and albums seem weird, that's just how 65dos does things. Don't think too hard about them or you might end up having a nosebleed.

65daysofstatic | One Time For All Time (8/10)
Favorite Tracks: Await Rescue, Welcome To The Times, Radio Protector, 65 Doesn't Understand You

Originally intended to be nothing more than a follow-up EP for TFOM, One Time For All Time ended up evolving onto the sophomore sequel to their debut. Compared to it, it doesn't really do that much differently than TFOM in terms of sounds, and it feels more like an expansion to that album than something new, but hey, it's still quite good, so I won't really complain that much.

65daysofstatic | The Destruction of Small Ideas (9/10)
Favorite Ideas: A Failsafe, Wax Futures, When We Were Younger & Better, Music Is Music As Devices Are Kisses Is Everything, The Distant & Mechanised Glow Of Eastern European Dance Parties/Little Victories, The Conspiracy of Seeds

Okay, now the "Post-Rock" tag is starting to have a lot more reason to be plastered onto 65dos—this album definitely works with its dynamics and how to slowly build up a track to its loudest, only to return for a moment to its quietest, and then return back to loud, while still keeping their previous elements of Math Rock, Glitch Music and DnB. It even features the first proper lyrics that aren't samples for the band on the ending track, The Conspiracy of Seeds, although as with the title of the tracks, its meaning isn't clear at all (something about a trial and betrayal, but good luck finding out what it means). 65dos is slowly starting to grow on me, it seems, so I'm hopeful the next studio album will be a banger as well.

65daysofstatic | Escape From New York (8/10)

A live album, and a good one that. I can't really say much beyond that—live albums can be such a wildly different experience from studio recordings on so many bands that it is often better to consider them a new experience, rather than a re-hash of old content.

65daysofstatic | We Were Exploding Anyways (9/10)
Favorite Tracks: Dance Dance Dance, Weak 4, Come To Me, Go Complex, Debutante, Tiger Girl

More and more, 65dos is starting to deviate towards electronica and dance music, almost completely abandoning those Glitch Music, DnB and Post-Rock elements from OTFAT and TDOSM, while keeping on some moments those high energy guitars and drumming. And you know what? For such a wild 180° change, they've hit it and succeeded in not coming off as them changing their sounds because the money said so, and more because they've believed this was the best way for the band to grow artistically. Oh, and Debutante is used in that ever so infamous E3 trailer for No Man's Sky, which is a hint for things to come if you're blind and have not read the next album after Wild Light for some reason.

65daysofstatic | Silent Running (8/10)
Favorite Tracks: Safe Distancing, The Scattered Disk, Rantaloupe, Broken Ship Ruse, Finale

An alternative soundtrack for, of all things, a 1972 environmentalist Sci-fi movie about one Freeman Lowell and three drones aboard the ship Valley Forge, filled with domes where live on Earth is preserved after life on Earth became extinct. The rest of the movie deals with Lowell after he is given the command to jettison and destroy the domes to turn the Valley Forge into a commercial freighter, and his actions thereafter.

For a good while I didn't even know that Silent Running was a movie, and that it was just a part of the 65dos' weird naming thing, but nope, this album was made with the movie in mind (in fact, the album was created after the band played live the re-score alongside with the movie). Other than that, this is solid a 65dos Post Rock rump like We Were Exploding Anyway, so I don't have much else to say.

Bada bing, bada boom, something something doom idk im tired

65daysofstatic | Wild Light (8/10)
Favorite Tracks: Heat Death Infinity Splitter, The Undertow, Sleepwalk City, Unmaking The Wild Light, Destructivist

As a continuation of Silent Running and We Were Exploding Anyway (more the latter than the first one), 65dos manage to create this weirdly dance-able and catchy Post-Rock Electronica fusion, something they would continue on working with their soundtrack for NMS. Oh yeah, 3 years after this album released, 65dos would start working directly with Hello Games to produce music for No Man's Sky, after Murray used one of their songs for the reveal trailer. Which leads us to...


65daysofstatic | No Man's Sky: Music for an Infinite Universe (10/10)
Favorite Planets: Blueprint for a Slow Machine, Red Parallax, Asimov, Monolith, Heliosphere, Escape Velocity, End of the World Sun

Composed for NMS and made of two discs, disc 1 features a more synth heavy, more ambiental Post-Rock sound than ever before, even more than Wild Light, with the music specifically made for the game, while disc 2 features what an usual soundscape in NMS sounds like, using loops, samples and riffs recorded by the band and then send over to HG for them to make into whatever they please. According to an interview by the band, 65dos were really looking to do some kind of soundtrack work, and saw NMS as a good opportunity to do so—it only took 5 minutes for the band to accept the job in a meeting, and the rest of it was spent talking about Sci-Fi.


For now, we shall pause the main 65daysofstatic chart for the time being. Now, it's time for the other chart I showed which features all the releases of "Unreleased/Unreleasable Volume 4: A Year of Wreckage", music based on the "Decomposition Theory, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Demand the Future", which is according to the band, "a performance built from music that will be generated in realtime by various algorithms we have made to do our bidding, or code that we type live".

65daysofstatic | Kazimir (8/10)
Favorite Tracks: KMF, SF_Ambient, Synthflood

65daysofstatic | Fugue State (8/10)
Favorite Tracks: FS_PianoVariant, FS_Redux, FS_Original

65daysofstatic | Looped Future (9/10)
Favorite Tracks: Woodpecker, taperec_5/taperec_6, Looped Future, taperec_4, Flown Wrong

65daysofstatic | Ptolyweirds (10/10)
Favorite Tracks: Ghost Club, Nines, Decapita, Ptolyweird

It will be easier to me to just listen a bunch of these things, group them all together and talk about them as a group, but holy balls are these first releases stacked. Kazimir, Fugue State and Looped Future more or less continue into that same Ambient Electronic sound that Music for an Inifinte Universe started with absolutely no guitar now and giving way to a completely synth sound, Ptolyweirds harkens back to the Glitch Drum n' Bass that The Fall of Math started and holy shit, for algorithmic music, this shit goes hard, even with the ambient breaks that are peppered through the tracks and the wholly and only ambient track on the EP, Decapita. Maybe my fear on this chart was unfounded, after all.

65daysofstatic | replicr, 2019 (8/10)
Favorite Tracks: Bad Age, Gr[]v-_s, Five Waves, Interference_2, Trackerplatz

It has now hit me that 65dos have gone full anti-capitalist, at least on what the band writes and members say. According to drummer Rob Jones, replicr, 2019 is about "the future, but that future got cancelled [...] This atemporality is an illusion, it’s the cultural logic of late capitalism, consuming everything faster and faster [...] Even the idea that ‘pop will eat itself’ is eating itself." I certainly wasn't expecting to return to Godspeed You! Black Emperor so quickly, but here we are, I guess. And yes, just like Exvironments, Pt. 1, there's always this sense that something is off, solitary and moody between electronic dance and the more ambiental interludes.

65daysofstatic | Exvironments, Pt. 1 (8/10)
Favorite Tracks: ex_2, ex_3

A series of long, droning ambient that the band describes as "Music For Airports except these days the world is literally on fire and the corporate, melancholy anaesthetic sheen of Eno's 70s airports has been steadily burning away for decades", which I can certainly see: most of the tracks have this dark, abandoned and solitary mood to them, and while this is exactly my kind of stuff, I can commend what they've done.

65daysofstatic | Miniatures (7/10)
Favorite Ideas: lies, extradition, fourteeneleventhirteen, valley stumble, milltwn1, nfntyCt•basic, polysines3, polysines4, all open, knotted_16, moor on fire

A compilation of unused snippets and ideas that date (at least, from me reading the dates given to tracks on the .pdf that comes with the download) all the way to 2013 during the Wild Lights era, but most coming from 2019 as the band started working more with the Decomposition Theory. While this kind of stuff is generally interesting for a deep fan of a band, for a normal listener, it will be a quite unfulfilling experience due to how short most of the tracks are (most range between 1 minute to 50 seconds, some more, some less) and since they never fully explore what they could be, it just feels like you're being pulled from one track to the other before they get into the good stuff. A bit surprising to find something like this here, but only listen to it if you're a fan of 65dos and want to hear what could have been.

65daysofstatic | 7over8 (8/10)
Favorite Dreams: 7over8, Strange Attractor, Ancient Also

As described by the band's notes, this was originally their attempt to making Vaporwave, with most of these songs originally coming from a collection of sketches from 2015 called "dreams" (sidenote: the notes mention the fact that Vaporwave has now attracted a considerable amounts of... proto-fascists and right-wingers? Alrighty then). I basically have no experience with Vaporwave besides the usual suspects that most people have heard (Lisa Frank 420/Modern Computing from Floral Shoppe and I think one other song?), and and the band even admits that 7over8 has grown beyond the Vaporwave label to become something a bit more electronic and, as the band writes, "reimagining Bladerunner as if it were set in Northern England".

65daysofstatic | Decomp Sketches (8/10)
Favorite Sketches: PlayrGen, Proto-[]lid, A Slight Geometry

Now, we feature something a bit like Miniatures, but in a more interesting way: instead of just random snippets of song ideas, Decomp Sketches is a collection featuring algorithms and programs that were tested by making these songs, but ended up being unused. The liner notes go into detail of how 65dos started working with the Decomposition Theory, and what tools were used for making these songs. For example, Drifter comes from the band's use of a system to help them keep the public entertained while they worked on fixing an issue that had suddenly appeared, while Proto-[]lid was created using a "a particularly enthusiastic beat generator we made with its emergency breaks and fondness for strict time signatures switched off."

---
65daysofstatic | Tempo Heavy (10/10)
Favorite Tempos: Stories, Escaper, Leaves, The Back of Things

Painted with the concept of "all music is a kind of time travel", Tempo Heavy leaves behind most synths and stays with only some occasional digital noise and sounds, and features a lot more real life samples of mainly piano chords and melodies, combined with strange sounds like the humming of a fuse box or creaking Soviet-era equipment in Budapest for what's probably the chilliest and most hopeful Year of Wreckage release, not dredged musically or conceptually by the post-capitalist, isolationism and commercialism ideas that 65dos has been exploring, but by fantasy and nature and carefree-ness, reminding me a lot of the work by C418 in Minecraft.

65daysofstatic | Resistor/Noise (7/10)
Favorite Noises: cascade, || (4), [D]RAIN
The only things in the liner notes are a brief purple prose and diagrams of electronics which I have no idea what they even mean. The most I can get from the title and what little I understand from the diagrams is that the sounds used were created from noise generated by a resistor? That's my only real guess as to what this all is: an experiment of creating music from resistor noises. And... eh, I guess it's not that bad, but it certainly isn't that interesting to me with its bloop and bleeps and [buzzing], but I could see others enjoying a lot more than me.

65daysofstatic | Exvironments Pt. 2 (8/10)
Favorite Exvironments: ex_6, ex_7, ex_9
A continuation of Exvironments Pt. 1, Pt.2 is a lot less dark in its texture, but still pretty moody all things considered. It also features GY!BE-like field recordings from time to time, from the sound of a bell ringing to the sound of birds in and weird mechanical sound shit. Overall, I think this is slightly better than Pt. 1, but eh, I'm not that big into pure ambient stuff in the first place.

65daysofstatic | Endings (**10/10**)
Favorite Endings: Goreki, Mother, Rounds, Pollen
As explained on the liner notes, Endings consist of four possible "futures", and the band suggests to the reader to choose one and go forward with it. Goreki is, despite the fact that it's part of a Decomp Theory project and was originally a completely algorithmic track, the only fully made track that doesn't come from Miniatures that was hand-crafted by the band, and the only one of it's kind. Mother is based on an beat loop in 13/8 created back on late 2017, Rounds is the finalized track of synth loop that the 65dos never managed to make into something meaningful, and Pollen was created alongside with the rest of Ptolyweirds, but was held back and finally released here.

The Year of Wreckage is over... one last stop before we choose our future, shall we?

65daysofstatic | Decomposition Theory Live 091017 (**10/10**)
Favorite Tracks: Curved Beats, Euclid Part 1/2, Mountain, Proto-KMF
This is a full recording of an early Decomposition Theory show, which puts it somewhere between January and March of 2019, before the release of the first Year of Wreckage EP, Kazimir. The fact that his is a full recording instead of a disparage collection means that songs flow seamessly between each other, to the point that while doing other things, I wasn't completely sure if I had moved on to the next song or not. It felt like an extended version of a Year of Wreckage EP, given free will to mutate to whatever it wished. And it's fucking awesome.
