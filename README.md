# Cello-Reviews

After deciding that doing a Neocities would probably not be a good idea since I would abandon it soon, I went with a more slightly more unorthodox place to save everything I've done so far. 

This is a collection of reviews that I've written throughout the years, starting on 2019 and continuing on. Including with these reviews are charts and clean charts for those who wish to follow my steps.
